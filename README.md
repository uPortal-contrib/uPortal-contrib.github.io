# uPortal-contrib Organization
uPortal-contrib is the entry path for projects and codebases desiring official recognition in the uPortal ecosystem.
Moreso, it is the organization where unofficial projects closely tied to uPortal can gestate and develop.

Periodically, the projects here will be reviewed for viability. Those still active will be encouraged to undergo the
[Intake Process](intake-process.md), while those inactive or no longer useful will be considered for
[uPortal-attic](https://github.com/uPortal-attic/).
